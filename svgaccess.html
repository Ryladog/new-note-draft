    <title>New SVG accessibility note - DRAFT</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>SVG 2 accessibility</h1>
    <p>This is a stub. The idea is to add to it until it turns into a document.
      That will take a lot of pull requests.</p>
    <p>Editor: chaals</p>
    <h2>Things that are still true</h2>
    <p>i.e. since the publication of SVG 1 and the poor <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SVG-access-20000807">old
        SVG accessibility note</a></p>
    <h3>basic shapes</h3>
    <p>to the extent that these can be helpful in understanding geometry, they
      are still there. Unfortunately there is a tendency in practice to use a
      lot of paths instead</p>
    <h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Re-Using">Re-usable
        "components"</a></h3>
    <p>the <code>use</code> element gives SVG something like what Web Components
      is still trying to bring to HTML a decade-odd later.</p>
    <h3>title and description</h3>
    <p>The way you can use these at appropriate levels of structure is a very
      nice thing.</p>
    <h3>DOM</h3>
    <p>Everything now uses the DOM, so it's helpful to have one.</p>
    <h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/#Fonts">Fonts</a></h3>
    <p>Now enhanced to match the new technology, fonts are a much nicer thing to
      do than simply adding a lot of paths to convey some text.</p>
    <h2>New improvements</h2>
    <h3>tabindex</h3>
    <p>Being able to build a keyboard navigation map around an SVG is a great
      thing. Element-wise navigation is a fallback strategy for users who don't
      have a choice, but it is unlikely to be a good one if the author has done
      a half-way reasonable job.</p>
    <h3>aria attributes</h3>
    <h2>Just different</h2>
    <h3>onclick is accessible now</h3>
    <p>DOMActivate was dropped because it was unnecessary, and unhelpful. Lack
      of browser support and lack of author usage fed a vicious circle.</p>
    <p>But onclick can be triggered by almost any mode of interaction - which
      was what DOMActivate tried to enable. So we have the functionality, even
      if it has a name that seems limiting.</p>
